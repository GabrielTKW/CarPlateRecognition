# CarPlateRecognition

A Python-based system for car plate recognition using OpenCV and Haar Cascades.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and car plate detection.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Pre-trained XML model for recognizing car plates, specifically optimized for Russian plates.

## Features
- Detects and identifies car plates from images.
- Uses Haar Cascade for accurate plate detection.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielTKW/CarPlateRecognition.git
