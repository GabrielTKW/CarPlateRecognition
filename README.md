CarPlateRecognition
A Python-based car plate recognition system using OpenCV's image processing capabilities and Haar Cascades.

Technologies Used
Python: Core language for processing.
OpenCV: For image processing and car plate detection.
Haar Cascade Classifier: Pre-trained XML model for recognizing car plates.
Features
Detects and identifies car plates from images.
Uses a dedicated Haar Cascade model optimized for Russian car plates.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run Main.py with OpenCV installed to begin detection.
